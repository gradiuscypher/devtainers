My development environment container setup. Using incus and some preconfigured images.

Documentation and TODO list is being actively worked on as I adjust my setup.


# TODO
- Helper for creating the incus container, generating the SSH key, and setting up the ssh config
- Helper for cloning a repo right into the container during setup
- Container network security: restrict outbound, monitor container connections and DNS queries
- Create containers on a separate network instead of bridged right to my home network, maybe wireguard or something?
- Method for adding my git deploy keys to the repo automatically, setup the `gits` alias automatically
- Tools like a configured zsh and tmux
- Dont run in the container as root


# How to Setup
TODO
